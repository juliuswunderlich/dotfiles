# dotfiles
All the relevant dot files, I customised over time.
Currently:

*   Vim
*   Tmux
*   zsh
*   ideavim (jetbrains products)

## Usage
Download them, cd into the folder and use mv .<FILE> $HOME/.<FILE> 

Careful! .vimrc contains a list of pathogen plugins. Remove the list to get rid of
the warning...

## Careful! .zshrc contains some oh my zsh plugins. Oh My Zsh can be installed
with:

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
