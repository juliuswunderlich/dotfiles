# dotfiles
All the relevant dot files, I customised over time.
Currently:

*   Vim
*   Tmux
*   zsh
*   ideavim (jetbrains products)
*   bash

## Usage
Download them, cd into the folder and use mv .<FILE> $HOME/.<FILE> 

Careful! .vimrc contains a list of pathogen plugins. Remove the list to get rid of
the warning...
